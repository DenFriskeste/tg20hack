While infiltrating a computer system belonging to a high value target, we
managed to exfiltrate a possibly interesting virtual machine.

We also captured the network traffic while it was running, but we are
unable to determine the content of the message being sent. It looks
encrypted.

If you are able to help us decipher the message, it could be of great importance.

## Files:
- [network capture](uploads/capture.pcapng)
- [vm binary](uploads/vm)
- [vm bytecode](uploads/dummy_encrypt_flag.assembly.out)
