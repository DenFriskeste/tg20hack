# Ransomware Part 2
**Author: Kakekongen**

**Difficulty: hard**

Again, someone managed to get their computed infected, resulting in some of
their important files being encrypted for ransom.
This time around, we did not only manage to recover one of
the object files, but the entire ransomware binary.

On the other hand, we were not capturing the network traffic at the time
when the ransomware was being run.

Hopefully, you are able to decrypt the ransomed files for us!

If it helps, the hostname of the machine is `ubuntu-server`.

**WARNING: The ransomware binary is actual ransomware which WILL encrypt and delete your files if executed, which without the key are lost!**

Relevant files:
