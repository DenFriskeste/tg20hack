# Starship Shellcoding Programme
The Starship Shellcoding Programme is one of three programs at Starfleet
to prepare for battles against Mother and her minions.

You may find the other two here:
* [Combat Ship Reversing Programme](link.til.tutorial)
* [Code Ciphering Programme](link.til.tutorial)

## Introduction
During the Starship Shellcoding Programme, we will start slowly by introducing the assembly
language, a common building block for all kinds of ships. The goal is to write
a piece of shellcode, which is a special type of code that can be used for both
attack and defence. But mostly for attacking.

At the end of the programme, you will be able to write your very own shellcode!
After completing the programme, you can move on to shellcoding for graduates,
where you will have the opportunity to create many types of wonderful shellcode.
