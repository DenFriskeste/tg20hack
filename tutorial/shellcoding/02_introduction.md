# Starship Shellcoding Programme Introduction

This programme will give you a basic understanding of assembly language and
shellcoding, two very important skills when conducting offensive and defensive
operations on Starships.

The only tool you need for this programme is a text editor where you will write
your assembly code. The code can be entered directly into our systems, which
will verify that your code is correct.

In addition to a text editor, it might be advantageous to use an assembler
to compile your code into a working program, and a debugger to verify that the
code works as intended. However, using a debugger is out of scope for this
programme.

## Roadmap
In the next section, you will get an introduction to the assembly language.
Following that section, we will dive into a few interesting assembly language
instructions, which are operations supported by the language.

In section 5, we will take a look at functions, which is a fundamental building
block of any programming language.

At the end, we will attempt to write our own shellcode, which will prepare you
for more difficult challenges relating to shellcoding and binary exploitation.
