# TG:HACK Space Academy 

Welcome to the TG:HACK Space Academy for motivated hackers and security enthusiasts! 
From now on you are called "cadets". We have been living on the planet Gaia for a while now, 
but we notice that less people are thinking about computers and security lately... 
This is exactly the reason how Mother managed to force us away from our planet last time. 
We don't want this to happen again, and that is why you got recruited to this academy! 
We welcome everyone that is interested in hacking or security, and together we will try our 
best to protect our planet from threats like Mother in the future!

But first you will need to learn some essential skills and solve tasks that will be very useful in future!

If you have any feedback to make the tasks better for beginners, or if you just want to tell us that you 
appreciate the tutorial, competition, or a special task, please fill our [feedback form](https://forms.gle/mvpcJaVtRJZQYR8z8). 

## Programmes
You are enrolled in the three programmes: Starship Code and Cypher School, Starship Shellcoding, and 
Combat Ship Reversing Programme.
"Cypher school" does not depend on any other tutorial. However, we recommend to check out the Shellcoding 
tutorial before trying to Reverse engineer. The recommended order of reading is:

1. [Starship Code and Cypher School](/page/crypto-tutorial): Learning about simple encoding, shift ciphers, and the encryption called XOR.
2. [Extraterrestrial Shellcoding Programme](/page/shellcoding-tutorial): Learning about the assembly language, and how registers work.
3. [Combat Ship Reversing Programme](/page/re-tutorial): Learning how to reverse engineer dangerous programs.

Good luck, cadets! Keep in mind that you are free to [contact](/page/contact) us if you are stuck! 
One of our crew members has a nice saying: _"There is no fun being stuck and  understanding  nothing... 
So if Google doesn't have the answer, why not ask us?"_

TODO: Add fun thing at the end. Something like the acceptance letter last year that has something to do with the lore!
