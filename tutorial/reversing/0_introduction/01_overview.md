## Introduction
The Combat Ship Reverseing Programme is a successor of the Starship Shell 
Coding Programme. The 
previous programme focused on the Assembly language, which is the building blocks of
all ships in the Galaxy. 

This programme does not completely rely on the knowledge learned from the previous 
programme. 
However, the understanding of the Assembly language makes reverse engineering 
a hell of a lot easier! Therefore, we recommend going through the  
[Starship Shell Coding Programme](link.til.tutorial) before moving on to
the fourth Exam of the Combat Ship Reversing Programme.

No previous experience with reverse engineering is required to follow this 
programme, and some might say it is a little easier than the previous
programme. 

We start the programme by introducing you to the `Reverse 
engineering` term, as well as things that are good to know to get started. 
Then, we move on to learning how to use common reverse engineering tools
to learn how software really works. 

This programme should make you comfortable enough to continue on exploring
reverse engineering in the future.
