## Overview
The files in this tutorial are separated into directories for each tutorial 
page. There is one exception to this rule, which is explained in the next
section. 

The folders starting with `0` indicates that they are not tutorial pages,
but rather introductional pages. These pages are put in the folder named
`0_introduction`.

The folders with numbers starting from 1 are tutorial pages that have a 
related challenge under the `n00b/re/` folder.
