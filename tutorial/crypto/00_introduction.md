# Starship Code and Cypher School

Good day, cadets! Here at the Starship Code and Cypher School,
our goal is to secure our own secrets, and reveal the secrets
of Mother and her minions.
In order to stand a chance against mother and her minions, we need
you to complete the SC&CS exams to get the proper level of knowledge
in order to be deployed alongside the rest of the Starfleet.
As for our name sister, the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley park, our success is
crucial for the human race to stand a chance against the forces of Mother.

This is one of the three Starship programmes,
and you may find the other two here:
* [Starship Shellcoding Programme](/page/shellcoding-tutorial)
* [Combat Ship Reversing Programme](/page/re-tutorial)

<br>

## Agenda 
This school will consist of five courses. Initially, you will be accustomed
to basic _encoding_. Later we will progress to _shift ciphers_, and finally
you will learn the cryptographic primitive _XOR_. This will prepare you for
real missions in the field, supporting the human race in our battle for humanity.

### Courses
| Course topic | Description |
|:------------:|:-----------:|
| Simple Encoding | How computers encode data, and how you can encode and decode it. |
| Shift Cipher | A historical note about additive ciphers, that are insecure, but helps build a strong fundament. |
| Frequency Analysis | How statistics can be used to break simple substitution ciphers. |
| Vigenere Cipher | Expanding shift ciphers by introducing more alphabets. |
| Stronger Cryptography | The operator XOR is fundamental to modern cryptography, preparing you for field missions. |

## Exams
During the courses, you will be given exams you must pass in order to fully
prepare you for field missions. You will be challenged, and your knowledge
expanded, but at the end of each of the courses, you will be ready for the exams.

| Exam name | Points |
|:---------:|:------:|
| Number Trouble | 25 |
| Secret Bases | 25 |
| Shifty Science | 25 |
| Frequency Analysis | 25 |
| Mega Shifting | 25 |
| Is This The One? Or Zero? | 50 |

You are now ready to start your courses.
Best of luck, cadet!
