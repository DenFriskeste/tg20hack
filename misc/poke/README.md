One of our agents on the ship recovered this file from a usb-stick found in 
the pockets of a space bandit. It appears that the space bandits are fans of 
an antique series of video games. We suspect there might be a flag hidden 
here. Have a look?

Remember to surround the flag with "TG20", so that the delivered flag is 
"TG20{"flag you found"}" 

The flag may or may not be split into two or more pieces. The final flag 
should be put together to form a full sentence.
