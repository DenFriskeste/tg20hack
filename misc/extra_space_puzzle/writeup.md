## Writeup
This is a Nonogram, also commonly known as Picross.

Should probably be fed into a solver, but can also be solved by hand. When 
puzzle is solved, you get a cute picture saying that the CTF team bootplug
will get over Hacking For Soju on CTFtime this year. Let the war begin!!
Love you, our Swedish friends <3
